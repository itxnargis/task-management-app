# Task Management App

## Overview

The Task Management App is a simple, user-friendly application that allows users to create, manage, and track tasks. Users can add new tasks, mark them as complete, edit existing tasks, delete tasks, and search through their tasks by title or description. The app stores functions in the browser's local storage, ensuring they persist even after a page refresh.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can input a title, description, and priority (High, Medium, Low) to create a new task.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can modify existing tasks, including changing the title, description, and priority.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks they no longer need.
- **Toggle Completion**: Users can mark tasks as completed or pending.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search through their tasks by title or description.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist across sessions.

## Technologies Used
